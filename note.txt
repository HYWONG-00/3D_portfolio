In case you have problem for installing vite in the beginning due to npm/node's version, perhaps you can try to uninstall node.js application from your computer (Control Panel -> Uninstall the application) and reinstall the latest version from the official website.
After installation is completed, you can try to 

npm -v
npm install npm@latest  
npm create vite@latest ./ -- --template react


There should be no problem anymore:)
